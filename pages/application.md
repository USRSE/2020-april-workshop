Thank you to everyone who expressed interest in attending the
workshop.  Unfortunately, we received significantly more applicants
than we are able to support.

We are striving to accommodate as many as possible, but workshop space
is limited and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse
participant group, both in terms of traditional diversity measures as
well as research domain and institutional representation.

While we will not be able to provide remote participation during the
workshop (check back [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved) for other
ways to get involved) we are actively working on organizing additional
community building events, potentially as part of an existing
conference or workshop.
