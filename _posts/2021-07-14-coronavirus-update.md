title: US-RSE Workshop Postponed to 2022

Due to the continued COVID-19 Pandemic, we have again made the
unfortunate but necessary decision to postpone the US-RSE Community
Building Workshop.
Given travel restrictions and our host's (Princeton University) restrictions on visitors and large gatherings we were unable to guarantee a successful and productive workshop in 2021.

The workshop has been postponed until April 26-27, 2022.

In the months leading up to the workshop, we will advertise and restart the
application/invitation process.
We will communicate with the broader US-RSE community via email and slack ([join US-RSE to be added](https://us-rse.org/join/)) as to the timing and next steps.
Expect occasional updates to also be posted here on the workshop website.
